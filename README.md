# Team Geeks
Here is a game from Team Geeks named THE CHASE! We have used raycasting to make a 2D game look like 3D. For testing purposes, we have parked the winning area as well but in the original game, it will not be present on the map. 

Following the theme we kept the game minimal but with some advancements like changing the speed of THE RED and adding proper graphics we can achieve better versions and interesting gameplay.

# About the Game: 
The game is about a person stuck in a dark maze and trying to escape from "THE RED" who is following him to kill.

# Controls:
W - Move Forward
s - Move Backward
A - Move Left
D - Move Right
Left Arrow - Turn Left
Right Arrow - Turn Right
E - To View the MAP
Space - To Sprint

# Instructions
You have to navigate your way in the map and find the escape but THE RED can pass through walls. On the map, an arrow shows the position of the player and a green box shows the position of THE RED. Don't let THE RED catch You

# Ideation: 
We took inspiration for the game from DOOM 1993 and Backrooms.
Music used: L tune from Death Note   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qR6dzwQahOM&ab_channel=joseuchiha80
